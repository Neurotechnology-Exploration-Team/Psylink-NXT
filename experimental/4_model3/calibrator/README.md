Don't.  I don't think you really want to use it, it's not really polished,
because I just build it for myself.  If this warning doesn't stop you, here are
some instructions:

1. Install Linux, Python3(.8), "xdotool"
2. Download code
3. Build a python virtual env based on the requirements.txt and activate it
4. Adjust constants in the code, like
    - Path to serial port of the microcontroller
5. From inside a terminal, run ./run.py
