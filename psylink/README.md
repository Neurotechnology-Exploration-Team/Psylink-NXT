# PsyLink

A myoelectric neural interface.

This is intended as a human input device (like a keyboard) that predicts your
intention from muscle signals.  Using a neural network, trained through a
process where you press keys at the exact same time that you make movements
with the limb wearing the device, it learns correlations between the muscle
signals and intended keys, and can press them for you.
